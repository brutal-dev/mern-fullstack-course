# Task 1 - News
## This is a task of the study plan I'm following.
### The task consists in the creation of a simple html news page, which should contain: an h1, an h2; a figure with an img and a figurecaption; 3 paragraphs and an unordered list;
### I should use Lorem Ipsum generated text to optimize productivity;
### I should also create a simple Figma Design to visualize how the structure of the page is gonna look like.
